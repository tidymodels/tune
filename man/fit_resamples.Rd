\description{
\code{fit_resamples()} computes a set of performance metrics across one or more
resamples. It does not perform any tuning (see \code{\link[=tune_grid]{tune_grid()}} and
\code{\link[=tune_bayes]{tune_bayes()}} for that), and is instead used for fitting a single
model+recipe or model+formula combination across many resamples.
}
\section{Performance Metrics}{


To use your own performance metrics, the \code{yardstick::metric_set()} function
can be used to pick what should be measured for each model. If multiple
metrics are desired, they can be bundled. For example, to estimate the area
under the ROC curve as well as the sensitivity and specificity (under the
typical probability cutoff of 0.50), the \code{metrics} argument could be given:

\preformatted{
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc, sens, spec)
}

Each metric is calculated for each candidate model.

If no metric set is provided, one is created:
\itemize{
\item For regression models, the root mean squared error and coefficient
of determination are computed.
\item For classification, the log-likelihood and overall accuracy are
computed.
}

Note that the metrics also determine what type of predictions are estimated
during tuning. For example, in a classification problem, if metrics are used
that are all associated with hard class predictions, the classification
probabilities are not created.

The out-of-sample estimates of these metrics are contained in a list column
called \code{.metrics}. This tibble contains a row for each metric and columns
for the value, the estimator type, and so on.

\code{collect_metrics()} can be used for these objects to collapse the results
over the resampled (to obtain the final resampling estimates per tuning
parameter combination).
}

\section{Obtaining Predictions}{


When \code{control(save_preds = TRUE)}, the output tibble contains a list column
called \code{.predictions} that has the out-of-sample predictions for each
parameter combination in the grid and each fold (which can be very large).

The elements of the tibble are tibbles with columns for the tuning
parameters, the row number from the original data object (\code{.row}), the
outcome data (with the same name(s) of the original data), and any columns
created by the predictions. For example, for simple regression problems, this
function generates a column called \code{.pred} and so on. As noted above, the
prediction columns that are returned are determined by the type of metric(s)
requested.

This list column can be \code{unnested} using \code{tidyr::unnest()} or using the
convenience function \code{collect_predictions()}.
}

\section{Extracting information}{


The \code{extract} control option will result in an additional function to be
returned called \code{.extracts}. This is a list column that has tibbles
containing the results of the user's function for each tuning parameter
combination. This can enable returning each model and/or recipe object that
is created during resampling. Note that this could result in a large return
object, depending on what is returned.

Note that the function given to the \code{extract} argument is evaluated on
every model that is \emph{fit} (as opposed to every model that is \emph{evaluated}).
As noted above, in some cases, model predictions can be derived for
sub-models so that, in these cases, not every row in the tuning parameter
grid has a separate R object associated with it.
