\arguments{
\item{verbose}{A logical for logging results as they are generated. Despite
this argument, warnings and errors are always shown.}

\item{allow_par}{A logical to allow parallel processing (if a parallel
backend is registered).}

\item{extract}{An optional function with at least one argument (or \code{NULL})
that can be used to retain arbitrary objects from the model fit object,
recipe, or other elements of the workflow.}

\item{save_pred}{A logical for whether the out-of-sample predictions should
be saved for each model \emph{evaluated}.}

\item{pkgs}{An optional character string of R package names that should be
loaded (by namespace) during parallel processing.}
}
\description{
Control the grid search process

\details{
For \code{extract}, this function can be used to output the model object, the
recipe (if used), or some components of either or both. When evaluated, the
function's sole argument has a named list with elements \code{recipe} and \code{model}.
If the formula method is used, the recipe element will be \code{NULL}.

The results of the \code{extract} function are added to a list column in the
output called \code{.extracts}. Each element of this list is a tibble with tuning
parameter column and a list column (also called \code{.extracts}) that contains
the results of the function. If no extraction function is used, there is no
\code{.extracts} column in the resulting object.

\code{control_resamples()} is an alias for \code{control_grid()} and is meant to be
used with \code{\link[=fit_resamples]{fit_resamples()}}.
