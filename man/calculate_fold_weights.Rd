\title{Calculate fold weights from fold sizes}
\usage{
calculate_fold_weights(rset)
}
\arguments{
\item{rset}{An rset object from \pkg{rsample}.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of weights proportional to fold sizes, normalized
to sum to 1.
}
\description{
This convenience function calculates weights proportional to the number of
observations in each fold's analysis set. Larger folds get higher weights.
This ensures that folds with more data have proportionally more influence
on the final aggregated metrics.
}
\details{
This is particularly useful for time-based folds (e.g., expanding window CV)
or stratified sampling  where folds might have slightly different sizes, in
which folds are imbalanced.
}
\examples{
library(rsample)
folds <- vfold_cv(mtcars, v = 3)
weights <- calculate_fold_weights(folds)
weighted_folds <- add_fold_weights(folds, weights)
