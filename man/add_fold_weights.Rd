\title{Add fold weights to an rset object}
\usage{
add_fold_weights(rset, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{rset}{An rset object from rsample.}

\item{weights}{A numeric vector of weights, one per fold.
Weights will be normalized.}
}
\value{
The rset object with weights added as an attribute.
}
\description{
This function allows you to specify custom weights for cross-validation
folds. Weights are automatically normalized to sum to 1.
}
\details{
Fold weights are useful when cross-validation folds have different
sizes or when you want to upweight certain folds in the evaluation.
The weights are stored as an attribute and used automatically during
metric aggregation.
}
\examples{
library(rsample)
folds <- vfold_cv(mtcars, v = 3)
# Give equal weight to all folds
weighted_folds <- add_fold_weights(folds, c(1, 1, 1))
# Emphasize the first fold
weighted_folds <- add_fold_weights(folds, c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25))
