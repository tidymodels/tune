\title{Extract resample weights from rset or tuning objects}
\usage{
get_resample_weights(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An rset object with resample weights, or a \code{tune_results} object.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of resample weights, or NULL if no weights are present.
}
\description{
This function provides a consistent interface to access resample weights
regardless of whether they were added to an rset object or are stored
in \code{tune_results} after tuning.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
library(rsample)
folds <- vfold_cv(mtcars, v = 3)
weighted_folds <- add_resample_weights(folds, c(0.2, 0.3, 0.5))
get_resample_weights(weighted_folds)
}
