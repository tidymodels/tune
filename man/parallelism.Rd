\title{Support for parallel processing in tune}
\description{
\pkg{tune} can enable simultaneous parallel computations. Tierney (2008)
defined different classes of parallel processing techniques:
\itemize{
\item \emph{Implicit} is when a function uses low-level tools to perform a
calculation that is small in scope in parallel. Examples are using
multithreaded linear algebra libraries (e.g., BLAS) or basic R vectorization
functions.
\item \emph{Explicit} parallelization occurs when the user requests that some
calculations should be run by generating multiple new R (sub)processes. These
calculations can be more complex than those for implicit parallel
processing.
}

For example, some decision tree libraries can implicitly parallelize their
search for the optimal splitting routine using multiple threads.

Alternatively, if you are resampling a model \emph{B} times, you can explicitly
create \emph{B} new R jobs to train \emph{B} boosted trees in parallel and return their
resampling results to the main R process (e.g., \code{\link[=fit_resamples]{fit_resamples()}}).

There are two frameworks that can be used to explicitly parallel process
your work in \pkg{tune}: the \link[future:future]{future} package and the
\link[mirai:mirai]{mirai} package. Previously, you could use the
\link[foreach:foreach]{foreach} package, but this has been deprecated as of
version 1.2.1 of tune.

By default, no parallelism is used to process models in \pkg{tune}; you have
to opt-in.
\subsection{Using future}{

You should install the package and choose your flavor of parallelism using
the \link[future:plan]{plan} function. This allows you to specify the number of
worker processes and the specific technology to use.

For example, you can use:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{   library(future)
   plan(multisession, workers = 4)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

and work will be conducted simultaneously (unless there is an exception; see
the section below).

If you had previously used \pkg{foreach}, this would replace your existing
code that probably looked like:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{   library(doBackend)
   registerDoBackend(cores = 4)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

See \code{\link[future:plan]{future::plan()}} for possible options other than \code{multisession}.

Note that \pkg{tune} resets the \emph{maximum} limit of memory of global variables
(e.g., attached packages) to be greater than the default when the package is
loaded. This value can be altered using \code{options(future.globals.maxSize)}.

If you want \pkg{future} to use \pkg{mirai} parallel workers, you can
install and load the \pkg{future.mirai} package.
}

\subsection{Using mirai}{

To set the specific for parallel processing with \pkg{mirai}, use the
\code{\link[mirai:daemons]{mirai::daemons()}} function. The first argument, \code{n}, determines the number
of parallel workers. Using \code{daemons(0)} reverts to sequential processing.

The arguments \code{url} and \code{remote} are used to set up and launch parallel
processes over the network for distributed computing. See \code{\link[mirai:daemons]{mirai::daemons()}}
documentation for more details.
}

\subsection{Reverting to sequential processing}{

There are a few times when you might specify that you wish to use parallel
processing, but it will revert to sequential execution:
\itemize{
\item Many of the control functions (e.g. \code{\link[=control_grid]{control_grid()}}) have an argument
called \code{allow_par}. If this is set to \code{FALSE}, parallel backends will
always be ignored.
\item Some packages, such as \pkg{rJava} and \pkg{keras} are not compatible with
explicit parallelization. If any of these packages are used, sequential
processing occurs.
\item If you specify fewer than two workers, or if there is only a single task,
the computations will occur sequentially.
}
}

\subsection{Expectations for reproducibility}{

We advise that you \emph{always} run \code{\link[=set.seed]{set.seed()}} with a seed value just prior to
using a function that uses (or might use) random numbers. Given this:
\itemize{
\item You should expect to get the same results if you run that section of code
repeatedly, conditional on using version 1.4.0 of tune.
\item You should expect differences in results between version 1.4.0 of tune and
previous versions.
\item When using \code{\link[=last_fit]{last_fit()}}, you should be able to get the same results as
manually using \code{\link[generics:fit]{generics::fit()}} and \code{\link[=predict]{predict()}} to do the same work.
\item When running with or without parallel processing (using any backend
package), you should be able to achieve the same results from
\code{\link[=fit_resamples]{fit_resamples()}} and the various tuning functions.
}

Specific exceptions:
\itemize{
\item For SVM classification models using the \pkg{kernlab} package, the random
number generator is independent of R, and there is no argument to control
it. Unfortunately, it is likely to give you different results from
run-to-run.
\item For some deep learning packages (e.g., \pkg{tensorflow}, \pkg{keras}, and
\pkg{torch}), it is very difficult to achieve reproducible results. This
is especially true when using GPUs for computations. Additionally, we have
seen differences in computations (stochastic or non-random) between
platforms due to the packages' use of different numerical tolerance
constants across operating systems.
