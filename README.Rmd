## Overview

The goal of tune is to facilitate hyperparameter tuning for the tidymodels packages. It relies heavily on [recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/), [parsnip](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/), and [dials](https://dials.tidymodels.org/). 

## Installation

Install from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("tune", repos = "http://cran.r-project.org") #or your local mirror
```

or you can install the current development version using:

```r
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/tune")
```

## Examples

There are several package vignettes, as well as articles available at [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/), demonstrating how to use tune.

Good places to begin include:

- [Getting started with cell segmentation data](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/tuning/)
- [Getting started with Ames housing data](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/getting_started.html)

More advanced resources available are:

 - [Basic grid search for an SVM model](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/work/tune-svm/)
 - [Iterative Bayesian optimization of a classification model](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/work/bayes-opt/)
 - [Advanced text mining example](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/extras/text_analysis.html)
 - [Notes on optimizations and parallel processing](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/extras/optimizations.html)
 - [Details on acquisition function for scoring parameter combinations](https://tune.tidymodels.org/articles/acquisition_functions.html)
