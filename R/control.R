#' Control the grid search process
#'
#' @param verbose A logical for logging results as they are generated. Despite
#'   this argument, warnings and errors are always shown. If using a dark IDE
#'   theme, some logging messages might be hard to see. If this is the case,
#'   try setting the `tune.dark` option with `options(tune.dark = TRUE)` to
#'   print lighter colors.
#' @param allow_par A logical to allow parallel processing (if a parallel
#'   backend is registered).
#' @param extract An optional function with at least one argument (or `NULL`)
#'   that can be used to retain arbitrary objects from the model fit object,
#'   recipe, or other elements of the workflow.
#' @param save_pred A logical for whether the out-of-sample predictions should
#'   be saved for each model _evaluated_.
#' @param pkgs An optional character string of R package names that should be
#'   loaded (by namespace) during parallel processing.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' For `extract`, this function can be used to output the model object, the
#' recipe (if used), or some components of either or both. When evaluated, the
#' function's sole argument has a named list with elements `recipe` and `model`.
#' If the formula method is used, the recipe element will be `NULL`.
#'
#' The results of the `extract` function are added to a list column in the
#' output called `.extracts`. Each element of this list is a tibble with tuning
#' parameter column and a list column (also called `.extracts`) that contains
#' the results of the function. If no extraction function is used, there is no
#' `.extracts` column in the resulting object.
#'
#' [control_resamples()] is an alias for [control_grid()] and is meant to be
#' used with [fit_resamples()].

#' Control the Bayesian search process
#'
#' @param verbose A logical for logging results as they are generated. Despite
#'   this argument, warnings and errors are always shown.
#' @param no_improve The integer cutoff for the number of iterations without
#'   better results.
#' @param uncertain The number of iterations with no improvement before an
#'   uncertainty sample is created where a sample with high predicted variance
#'   is chosen. The iteration counter is reset after each uncertainty sample.
#'   For example, if `uncertain = 10`, this condition is triggered every 10
#'   samples with no improvement.
#' @param seed An integer for controlling the random number stream.
#' @param extract An optional function to collect any information from the model
#'   or other objects. See [control_grid()] for details. Note that if initial
#'   results were already generated using [tune_grid()], care must be taken if
#'   the Bayesian search has a different extraction function.
#' @param save_pred A logical to save the out-of-sample predictions from each
#'   resample and each parameter combination. See [control_grid()] for details.
#' @param time_limit A number for the minimum number of _minutes_ (elapsed) that
#'   the function should execute. The elapsed time is evaluated at internal
#'   checkpoints and, if over time, the results at that time are returned (with
#'   a warning). This means that the `time_limit` is not an exact limit, but a
#'   minimum time limit.
#' @param pkgs An optional character string of R package names that should be
#'   loaded (by namespace) during parallel processing.
